To resolve the issue, we must ensure the object's lifecycle is properly managed within the asynchronous operation. One effective method involves checking for `nil` before accessing `weakSelf`:

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        MyObject *localObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
        if (weakSelf) { 
            [weakSelf setMyObject:localObject];
        }
    });
}
```

Alternatively, we could use a strong reference within the block, but be mindful of retain cycles. A safer approach is to utilize `dispatch_once` for one-time operations to minimize the window for this timing issue. 

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod {
    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ 
        MyObject *localObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];
        self.myObject = localObject;
    });
}
```

Choosing the best solution depends on the specific circumstances of the code.  Always prioritize robust memory management and lifecycle control when dealing with asynchronous operations in Objective-C.
